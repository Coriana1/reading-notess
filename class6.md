##JavaScript Object Basics

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
    - The object has the stae, behavior and identity and it differs based on the type we use. But for example, if I said give me a pen then the pen would be an object. The object has some sort of data that models the sentence and has an identity to make it meaningful.
2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
    - Flexibility (you can drop them anywhere in you program with no previous setup), convenience. 
3. How do objects differ from arrays?
   - Objects represent things with properties and arrays create and store losts of data.
4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
    - If you have a object called "name" with a property "Coriana" we would access "Coriana" but using name["Coriana"]
5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
    - This refers to an object and which object depends on how *this* is invoked (called/used) and the benifit is making multiple copies of an object. 

#Introduction To The DOM
1. What is the DOM?
    - *Document Object Model* - defines the logcial structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
    - **JavaScript** is a programming language that the web browser executes and **DOM** is the actual HTML elements.
