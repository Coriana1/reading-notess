## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
    *- Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model designed to provide greater control over alignment and space distribution between items within a container. Meaning Flexbox can work on either row or columns at a time, but Grids can work on both.*
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
    - *The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your main axis is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis runs down the columns.*
      **If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows**
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
  - *Using flexbox could cause performance issues. It can increase the page loading time if you have a larger project.*
