# Learn HTML

## Creating Hyperlinks
1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
    - <a> (anchor element) and itcreates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address. 
2. The href attribute contains what information?
    - The URL of the page the link goes to.
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
    - Don't capitalize all letters, avoid using URLs, don't use the word "link" as part of the link text

## CSS Layout - CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning
1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
    - The way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made
2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
    - Block elements always start from a new line (causes a line break) and inline elements never do (doesn't force a new line). Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go while Inline elements only cover the space bounded by the tags in the HTML element. 
3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
    - Static
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
    - Allows you to place any page element exactly where you want it and less dependence on floats and margins
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
    - Absolute are positioned with respect to a containing block, which is the nearest postioned ancestor(element with a set of position valuse other than static). If there is no positioned ancestor, the viewport will be the containing block. Elements with fixed positioning are fixed with respect to the viewport—the viewport is always their containing block.

## JS - Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code
1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
    - The function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions.Also declared functions are not executed immediately.**They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).**
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
    - The values that are declared within a function when the function is called is an argument. The variables that are defined when the function is declared is a parameter.

**6 Reasons for Pair Programming**
1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
    - Fewer coding mistakes is a huge one because that will less the time you spend working on a project, also it's more effcient because it's two different people with different sets of knowledge to bring to the task. With two people the ideas are flowing quicker, work getting completed smoother, and you have someone to support you when you are having a hard time but praise you when you're doing a good job.
