##Troubleshooting JavaScript.
1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
   - Syntax errors happen when there's a mistake in our code, such as a semicolon. Logic error is when you have the right syntax but a part of the code of the program within has an error. 
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
   - *When trying to link my css and css reset I forgot to add ../ to link directly to the style sheet.*
   - *I added a "#" before naming my css which caused the code not to work*
   - *I overlooked a opening { which caused an error to my app.js* 
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
   - Using the console.log and reading each discrepancy line by line is the best way to get down to the root of all issues. I plan to use that method as I evolve as a developer. 
#The JavaScript Debugger.
1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
   - You can set breaking point in JS code, and at the breaking points JS will stop executing & let you view JS values.
2. Define what a breakpoint is.
   -nLogical points that you want the code execution to pause (so you can debug).
3. What is the call stack?
   - It's like the JS interpreter in a web browser, and it keeps track of its place in a script that calls multiple function.
